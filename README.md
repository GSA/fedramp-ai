# Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) - Artificial Intelligence

## Emerging Technology Prioritization Framework

In response to the President’s [Executive Order 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/), FedRAMP is establishing a framework for prioritizing emerging technologies (ETs) for FedRAMP authorization. The term “emerging technology” means those technologies listed in the Office of Science and Technology Policy [Critical and Emerging Technologies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/02/12/white-house-office-of-science-and-technology-policy-releases-updated-critical-and-emerging-technologies-list/).  This framework will enable routine and consistent prioritization of the most critical cloud-relevant ETs needed for use by federal agencies. This prioritization will control how FedRAMP prioritizes its own work and review processes, and will not address how sponsoring agencies manage their own internal priorities.

Not all ETs will be prioritized. The initial ET prioritization list includes generative AI capabilities: chat interfaces, code-generation and debugging tools, and associated application programming interfaces (APIs), as well as prompt-based image generators, as required by Executive Order 14110.  

As part of the application process for CSO's to be prioritized, the cloud service provider is required to provide a publicly available model card that defines model details, uses, biases and risks, training details about the data, procedure, and parameters as well as evaluation factors, metrics, and results to include benchmarks used.

## Model Template
The FedRAMP model card template is derived from the [standard huggingface model card template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md) with additional fields identified as optional.   The FedRAMP model card template is [here](./modelcard-template.md)
