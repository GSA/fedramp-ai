# Model Card for Model ID

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

This modelcard aims to be a base template for new models. It has been generated using [this raw template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md?plain=1).   It has been modified to request additional items to support FedRAMPs analysis of emerging technologies for artificial intelligence.

## Model Details

## FedRAMP - Intended Uses 

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. FedRAMP requires these items to be described.-->

### Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->

[More Information Needed]

### Downstream Use [optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->

[More Information Needed]

### Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->

[More Information Needed]

## FedRAMP - Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. This section is required by FedRAMP to be presented to the federal government. -->

[More Information Needed]

### FedRAMP - Security [optional]

<!-- This section is meant to describe the technical security that has been applied, and any security controls or analysis that has been performed to keep the product from being manipulated by adversaries.  It should also describe any penetration testing that has occurred and the outcome or vulnerabilities of that testing. -->

More information is necessary to describe the security of the model.

### Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.

## Training Details

<!-- This should describe the details of the training process and procedures -->

### FedRAMP Training Specifics

<!-- This should include the Freshness of the data in YYYY/MM format where the data includes the year and month of the most recent data in the model.  The trains on government data identifies whether the model or offering continues to learn from, process, and store, data and inputs that are submitted to the offering.  -->
